# Design of Dynamic Source Routing Protocol for Mobile Sensor Networks

_BY FAN TSZ CHUEN_

## Abstract

In order to get the immediate information from each sensor that the primary host cannot directly connect to in a hazardous area, I have designed and optimized a routing protocol to facilitate communication within the network.

The design goal of such an ad hoc network routing protocol is efficient for establishing routes among nodes so that the immediate message can be delivered in a timely manner. By comparison of current routing schemes for ad hoc mobile wireless networks, the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol is selected to be the foundation of my designed routing protocol. The designed protocol follows the tradition of DSR containing two major mechanisms of “Route Discovery” and “Route Maintenance”. The protocol is designed to be simple, efficient and entirely on-demand for all aspects.

By means of computer simulations, I obtain different sets of results under different simulating conditions so as to create an evaluated and optimized routing protocol.

This report aims to illustrate the characteristics and operations of the designed routing protocol and provide methods to verify its practicability and performance.
